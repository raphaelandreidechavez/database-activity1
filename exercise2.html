   <dt>Adobe Acrobat Reader</dt>
   <dd>Acrobat Reader is software that allows you to view a PDF document (a document that can be seen but not changed). It can be downloaded free of charge from Adobe.</dd>
   <dt>Analogue</dt>
   <dd>Analogue is a conventional method of transmitting data. Standard landline telephones use analogue technology. It is distinct from digital technology, which provides for greater quality and speed of data transmission.</dd>
   <dt>Assistive technology</dt>
   <dd>Assistive technology refers to any software or hardware that acts to assist and improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities. Examples include wheelchairs, prosthetics, voice-to-text technology and text-to-speech technology.</dd>
   <dt>Attachment</dt>
   <dd>An attachment is a document sent with an email message. Many types of files can be sent this way (e.g. Word documents, PDFs, Excel files, JPEGs). Be wary of attaching large files because these can take a lot of time for the recipient to download. If you have a large file, it is considered good practice to compress the file using software such as Winzip before attaching it.</dd>
   <dt>Back-end</dt>
   <dd>Back-end refers to the part of an application that performs an essential task not apparent to the user.</dd>
   <dt>Backward compatible</dt>
   <dd>If software is backward compatible, it is compatible with earlier (superseded) versions of the same software. For example, the Microsoft word-processing program Word 2010 can read files created in the 2003 version of the same program, so it is backward compatible.</dd>
   <dt>Bandwidth</dt>
   <dd>Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can travel a communications path in a given time, usually measured in seconds.</dd>
   <dt>Bit</dt>
   <dd>A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of measurement in computing. 8 bits make up 1 byte.</dd>
   <dt>Bluetooth</dt>
   <dd>Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology intended to replace cables. It allows short-range connections between two or more Bluetooth-compatible devices such as mobile phones, tablets, headsets or medical equipment.</dd>
   <dt>Bookmark</dt>
   <dd>A bookmark is a saved link to a particular Web page. Microsoft Internet Explorer denotes bookmarks as "favourites."</dd>
   <dt>Boolean operators</dt>
   <dd>Most search engines (e.g. Google) allow you to limit your search or make it more specific by using words such as "and", "or" and "not". These words are known as boolean operators because of their origin as terms in logic.</dd>
   <dt>Boot (re-boot)</dt>
   <dd>To boot (or re-boot) is to load and initialise the operating system on a computer. Think of it as starting up your computer. In Windows you can use the key combination CTRL and ALT and DEL as a "soft" boot. This means restarting the computer rather than turning it completely off and on again, which could cause damage to your computer's hard disk under some circumstances.</dd>
   <dt>Bounce back</dt>
   <dd>An email message that cannot be delivered and returns an error notification to the sender is said to "bounce back". If you receive such an error notification, check that you have typed the address correctly.</dd>
   <dt>Broadband</dt>
   <dd>Broadband is a type of communications technology whereby a single wire can carry more than one type of signal at once; for example, audio and video. Cable TV is one technology that uses broadband data transmission.</dd>
   <dt>Browser</dt>
   <dd>A software program that allows you to surf the web. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.</dd>
   <dt>Cache</dt>
   <dd>When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer. The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly. The downside to this is that if the cached web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version. If you suspect that the web page you're seeing is not the latest version, use the "refresh" button on your browser.</dd>
   <dt>CAD</dt>
   <dd>Computer-aided design (CAD) is a type of software that allows users to create 2D and 3D design and modelling. CAD is used by architects, engineers, artists and other professionals to create precise technical drawings.</dd>
   <dt>Chip</dt>
   <dd>A chip is a microprocessor that performs many functions and calculations that make your computer run. Your computer's chip is also referred to as the CPU (Central Processing Unit) or the processor.</dd>
   <dt>Cloud computing</dt>
   <dd>Cloud computing refers to the storing and accessing of data and programs over the Internet instead of on another type of hard drive. Examples of Cloud services include iCloud, Google Cloud and Dropbox.</dd>
   <dt>Compression</dt>
   <dd>Compression is the reduction of the size of a file. Compressed files take up less memory and can be downloaded or sent over the Internet more quickly.</dd>
